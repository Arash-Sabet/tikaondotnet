# Contributing

We love it when people help us out.

## Having a problem?

Search in the [Issues](https://github.com/KevM/tikaondotnet/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue%20)
as your problem may be a common one. If don't find your problem. Do [create an
issue](https://github.com/KevM/tikaondotnet/issues/new). Contributors here will
chime in when they can.

## Getting Started

Check out the [ReadMe](https://github.com/KevM/tikaondotnet). It should have
everything you need to get started.

### The Usual

Did a new version of Tika come out and you want to get the Nuget updated? This is
very common so check out the ReadMe on [Updating Tika](https://github.com/KevM/tikaondotnet#updating-tika).
After you've got the new version building, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
Once it is merged a [Nuget will be published](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TikaOnDotNet/).
