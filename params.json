It may sound scary but it is possible to leverage Java libraries from .Net applications without any TCP sockets or web services getting caught in the crossfire using [IKVM](http://www.ikvm.net/). I've done the hard work for you and built the .Net version of Tika for you and bundled the supporting IKVM runtime libraies. \r\n\r\n#### Tests\r\n\r\nA basic set of unit tests are present in this project to verify that Tika is working. These tests extract text from test documents. The following rich document types are tested:\r\n\r\n* Adobe PDF - .pdf\r\n* Microsoft Word - .doc and .docx\r\n* Microsoft Excel - .xls and .xlsx\r\n* Microsoft PowerPoint - .ppt and .pptx\r\n* Rich Text Format - .rtf\r\n* Zip files - .zip (only a listing of the filenames in the .zip file are extracted)\r\n* JPEG - .jpg (image metadata)\r\n\r\nFor more details on how this is accomplished checkout [this blog post](http://www.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/kmiller/archive/2010/07/02/using-the-tika-java-library-in-your-net-application-with-ikvm) from @KevM\r\n\r\n### Cloning \r\n\r\nYou can use your favorite git client to clone this repository.
